# hangman
Have saved two versions of the game. 
The first one (main.rb and hangman.rb) was with storing each instance variable in a file that was loaded into their respective values
The second one (main2.rb, serialize2.rb and hangman.rb) was after I learnt to serialize the instance variables into JSON files using the instance variable get and set methods.

games get saved in the saved_games folder for both the versions
